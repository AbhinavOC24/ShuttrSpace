# üì∏ ShuttrSpace

**ShuttrSpace** is a full-stack photography platform that blends professional portfolio features with **Web3-powered content ownership**.  

Photographers can upload, manage, and share their work, with the option to store media on decentralized storage (IPFS) and publish metadata to the Solana blockchain for **verifiable, tamper-proof ownership records**.

## üõ† Tech Stack

### **Frontend**
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + Tailwind CSS
- [Solana Wallet Adapter](https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter)
- Client-side thumbnail generation via `<canvas>` or `sharp` (backend fallback)

### **Backend**
- Node.js + Express
- Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL
- CORS + secure session handling
- IPFS integration via [Web3.Storage](https://web3.storage/) or [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/)

### **Web3 Components**
- **Blockchain**: Solana
- **Smart Contract Framework**: Anchor
- **Account Structure**:
  ```
  #[account]
  pub struct UserPortfolio {
      pub owner: Pubkey,
      pub items: Vec<String>, // metadata CIDs
  }
  ```

### **On-chain Instructions**
- `initializePortfolio()` ‚Üí creates a PDA (Program Derived Address) portfolio account for the user
- `addPortfolioItem(metadata_cid)` ‚Üí appends a new IPFS CID to the user's on-chain portfolio

### **Decentralized Storage**
- **Full-resolution image** ‚Üí stored on IPFS
- **Thumbnail** ‚Üí stored on IPFS for fast retrieval
- **Metadata JSON** ‚Üí stored on IPFS containing:
  ```
  {
    "name": "Stormy Skies",
    "tags": ["landscape", "monsoon"],
    "author": "WalletAddress",
    "image": "ipfs://originalCID",
    "thumbnail": "ipfs://thumbnailCID",
    "signature": "signedHash"
  }
  ```

### **Verification**
- Metadata signature is validated using TweetNaCl to confirm that the uploader's wallet private key signed the file hash
- If verified, the profile displays a "Verified Author" badge
